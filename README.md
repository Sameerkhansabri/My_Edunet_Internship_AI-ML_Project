Employee Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a machine learning model that predicts an employee’s salary based on their years of experience using Linear Regression.

⸻

📌 Project Objective

To build and evaluate a regression model that can:
	•	Analyze the relationship between experience and salary
	•	Predict salaries for unseen experience levels
	•	Visualize trends and distributions in the dataset

⸻

📊 Dataset
	•	Source: Synthetic dataset generated using NumPy
	•	Features:
	•	YearsExperience (float): Total years of experience
	•	Salary (float): Corresponding salary in dollars

⸻

🔧 Technologies Used
	•	Python 🐍
	•	Pandas & NumPy
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn
	•	scikit-learn (Linear Regression Model)
	•	Jupyter Notebook

⸻

🚀 Steps Performed
	1.	Data Generation & Cleaning
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	3.	Model Training using Linear Regression
	4.	Model Evaluation – R² Score, MAE, MSE
	5.	Prediction Output
	6.	Visualizations – Scatter plots, Histograms
